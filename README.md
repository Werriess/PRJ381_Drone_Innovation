# Gas Detection Drones for Mines

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a drone equipped with gas sensors to detect hazardous gases in underground mines. The drone collects real-time data, ensuring safety in dangerous environments by providing early warnings and alerts.

## Features
- Gas Detection: Equipped with sensors to detect gases like methane, carbon monoxide, and other harmful substances.
- Arduino Integration: Uses an Arduino microcontroller to handle sensor inputs and data transmission
- 3D Model Integration: Displays a 3D model of the drone for better visualization using three.js and @react-three/fiber.
